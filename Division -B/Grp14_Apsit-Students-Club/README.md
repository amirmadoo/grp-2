Description:
In this phase, a logical system is built which fulfills the given requirements. The design phase 
of software development deals with transforming the clientâ€™s requirements into a logically 
working system. Normally, design is performed by the following two steps.
1. Primary Design Phase: 
In this phase, the system is designed at the block level. The blocks are created based
on analysis done in the problem identification phase. Different blocks are created 
for different functions emphasis is put on minimizing the information flow between 
blocks. Thus, all activities which require more interaction are kept in one block.
2. Secondary Design Phase:
In the second phase, the detailed design of every block is performed. The general tasks 
involved in the design process are the following:
1. Design various blocks for overall system processes.
2. Design smaller, compact and workable modules in each block. 
3. Design various database structures. 
4. Specify details of programs to achieve the desired functionality. 
5. Design the form of inputs, and outputs of the system. 
6. Perform documentation of the design.
